    "content": "Founded in 2016, the firm’s robo advisor, Goyabot, offers market prediction for some 180 cryptocurrencies, speculating future price movements by using data generated from real-time market monitoring. Goyabot predicts crypto price fluctuations by analyzing buy and sell orders entered on exchanges, transaction data carried out on a blockchain network and liquidations taking place in the market. Based on the data, it provides scores for cryptocurrencies, evaluating their profitability and stability. The scores are made into graphs, known as Goya charts, which give signals for buying and selling.\n As the cryptocurrency market operates on a 24-hour basis, the robo advisor offers real-time analysis around the clock to provide a better trading environment for investors, helping them to make more informed decisions. Around 20 tech experts at the company generate the AI by analyzing data and setting up new algorithms to respond to the market.\nThe service, which has been provided for free for the past five years, has now been put behind a paywall worth 13,000 won ($10) per day. Some 15,000 users have so far subscribed to the service, according to the company. Hoping to break into new markets outside of Korea, the firm operates four overseas branches outside of the country -- in Singapore, Hong Kong, the US and the UK. It further plans to launch an automated trading service for investors in March, linking its investment portfolio with automatic purchases and sales for those who are unable to utilize the company’s charts.\nThe service, which is still in its trial period, has been generating an average profit of 10 percent. The automated trading service will allow investors to see stable profits, the company said. Youth Meta's affiliates include BlockSquare Seoul, the marketing branch ReTri, crypto asset growth platform Rising X, crypto foundation VOB, and finance and investment arm Block Square Investment. It further hopes to expand its business into the unmanned aerial vehicle industry in the near future, seeing potential in the drone service sector.",

    "title": "[Herald Interview] BlockSquare CTO on importance of real-time data in navigating crypto market",
    "subtitle": "From charting tool to trading bot, BlockSquare Seoul hopes to offer ultimate crypto trading assistance",
    "content": "Speed and accuracy in processing real-time data are key requisites for interpreting the volatile cryptocurrency market, said Won Hyuk, chief technical officer at BlockSquare Seoul. The crypto trading assistance company has created a charting tool for investors, which helps with trading analysis. Its AI-powered Goya algorithm suggests the best time to buy and sell, reading into the market price fluctuation of cryptocurrencies.“We convert figures from orderbook, on-chain data and liquidation attempts into scores through calculation, having the algorithm figure out when would be the right time to place orders,” Won said in a recent interview held with The Korea Herald.\n“Plus points are given when asset holders maintain a ‘long’ position, minus points are given when liquidations happen on a ‘short’ position,” Won explained.According to Won, the Goya charting tool has shown a high accuracy rate in its suggestion of trading signals. “We recently compiled the data which shows the tool’s accuracy rate stands at between 80 to 90 percent for top-traded coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple. The figure for other cryptocurrencies is expected to be somewhere in the 80 to 90 percent range, too,” Won said. The most difficult part of designing the algorithm for the charting tool was pulling the data from cryptocurrency exchanges. Though the data was accessible as on-chain transactions are carried out on a blockchain network, the challenge lay in figuring out the right speed with which to attain it.\n\"For instance, when we take data from Binance at a speed that is too fast, we are considered as a cyberattack and the exchange blocks out our Internet Protocol address. But if we bring the data at a much slower pace, it would not be real-time data anymore because of the time gap,” Won said. “Through many failures, we have figured out an optimal pace to bring in the data,” he explained. Adding to the charting tool service, the company plans to launch an automated trading bot next year. Though it currently offers automated trading for buying cryptocurrency, it also plans to expand the service to selling. “There are many trading autobot services out there. But from my understanding, most of the services place buying or selling orders for customers one by one. Then, there would be a gap between the first and last transaction, leading to a price gap,” he said. “But we have worked out a way to put in the signals all at once. That was not easy to figure out, but we managed.”\nThough the algorithm is powered by artificial intelligence, a certain amount of human interference is inevitable as AI can only be trained to perform specific tasks for the time being.\"We made the AI algorithm think like a human being. Because in the end, investments are powered by human decisions. But as the algorithm is run mechanically, it can perform ideal decision-making, unlike humans who are often swayed by emotions,” Won explained. One of the ways that the company’s autobot can halve risks is by liquidating assets when volatility in a cryptocurrency increases. “By putting in a code for liquidation on the cut-line, the autobot can automatically minimize losses,” Won said, adding the service in its test trial period has been seeing an early 10 percent profit on average.\nWon believes tech can only excel when data processing is continuously improved. It is not just about building the system but keeping things updated. “Though there have been many companies offering a similar solution to ours using scores and charts, most have disappeared. This shows maintaining the service through updating data and improving accuracy matters more than creating the technology itself,” he said. “Tech will only further develop as time passes. I hope to launch more services that can provide convenience and improve profitability in crypto trading for investors,” he said.",

    "content": "The answers are all out there in the charts for Iron Won, who leads Youth Meta, the holding company of crypto trading service operator BlockSquare Seoul. After a prolonged period of uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market, the crypto winter seems to have come to an end. As market sentiment lightens up, Won has one piece of advice for investors -- to predict market trends by tracking asset movements. “It is nearly impossible for an average person to approach the crypto market, as it is exposed to extreme price fluctuations,” Won said in an interview with The Korea Herald on Monday. “The market is led by futures, not spot exchanges, making it even more difficult to predict,” Won said. “It is nearly impossible to beat high-leveraged investments, no matter how many bitcoins you hold.”\nAccording to Won, there are “forces” that dominate the crypto market with bold, premeditated transactions. The only way to beat these forces is to read their movements, processing on-chain data, meaning verified blockchain transactions.“As the market is operated under distributed ledger technology, we can monitor wallet-to-wallet or wallet-to-exchange transactions. If we keep track of these activities, we can read into the price fluctuations and provide leading indicators of the market.”BlockSquare Seoul offers crypto charts for investors. Its AI-powered service Goyabot provides market intelligence, reading the price movements of major cryptocurrencies, and suggests the best time to buy and sell. The service has garnered some 15,000 users since it set up a paywall last year.Taking advantage of the crypto industry, which operates beyond borders, the company has been expanding its business to the overseas market. It operates a total of four overseas branches in Singapore, Hong Kong, the US and the UK. About 70 percent of its users are located outside of Korea, with the largest group coming from Japan.\n“The answers are all in the charts. There is no language barrier when it comes to crypto trading,” Won said. Backed by the growth in the charting service, BlockSquare Seoul is to launch an automatic transaction service next year. Linked to the company’s investment portfolio, the service will automate purchase and sales for investors who are unable to utilize the charts. The service, in a test trial period for the time being, has been seeing a 10 percent profit on average, Won said. This is relatively higher than the average single-digit profit seen in AI-based investments for the stock market. “Different from shares, the crypto market does not have limits on price surges or dips, meaning it can generate high risk and high profit. A 10 percent profit is an achievable figure in this industry,” he said.\nIn recent years, Korea has been working to regulate the prominent virtual asset market. The Act on the Protection of Virtual Asset Users, which aims to regulate unfair transaction activities in the market, is set to take effect in July 2024. The second phase of the act, currently underway, is to regulate players in the industry. “Some of the cryptocurrencies in the market are made to cause harm to investors. Tight monitoring of the market is necessary,” Won said, welcoming the legislative efforts. However, Won stressed that authorities must have a thorough understanding of the virtual asset market. Though the company’s service is limited to the crypto trading market for the time being, Won hopes it can grow to provide diverse services related to the blockchain industry, from administrative affairs to banking. “There will come a time when every aspect of our lives will be connected to blockchain technology. I hope BlockSquare Seoul can play a pivotal role, linking users to services,” he said.",
